    "- Working knowledge of quantitative investing: **how to construct and backtest trading strategies**\n",

    "## **Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basics of using Python \n",
    "   - Python coding is often done in an IDE such as PyCharm/VSCode or in **Jupyter notebooks**\n",
    "   - Jupyter notebooks are convenient in that you can write notes and code side by side and, because code is executed in steps, debugging is easy\n",
    "   - We can write standalone 'scripts' or larger projects that consist of multiple files\n",
    "     - Python files typically have .py extensions; notebooks have .ipynb extensions\n",
    "   - We will use Jupyter Lab through Dartmouth's own system at jhub.dartmouth.edu\n",
    "   - The goal is to get you up and running to the point where you know where to look up more information\n",
    "   - **If** you work in an organization that uses Python, there would likely be a common codebase (repository) that is maintained with git or svn \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loading and analyzing financial data\n",
    "   - Get data from public sources using APIs as well as from commonly used databases (CRSP and Compustat)\n",
    "   - Explore data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Construct academic factors\n",
    "   - Understanding the decisions made for constructing factors\n",
    "   - Examine sensitivity to the strategy rules: when you construct a trading rule, you have to make many decisions about *what* and *how* you trade\n",
    "   - Construct additional factors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Predict stock returns and trade these predictions\n",
    "   - Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning method:**\n",

    "## Background on Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a new Python session, there is nothing (except basic Python) in the memory\n",
    "- This is true even if you open an old notebook that has code in it\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run code in cells, objects get defined and they remain in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a counter next to each cell that has been executed to indicate the execution order\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clear the memory by **restarting the kernel**\n",
    "- Each notebook (if you have many open) has its own kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "If you execute code and want to force it to stop, you can **interrupt the kernel**\n",
    "- Execution breaks but memory isn't cleared (but whatever *was* executed has altered objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented programming language \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is object oriented programming language\n",
    "- This means that most of the things in the language are objects with their own properties and methods\n",
    "- What does this mean?\n",
    "  - If we have list of numbers, we (typically) would **not** call a separate function to add an element to that list\n",
    "    \n",
    "    MY_LIST = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    MY_LIST = ADD_ITEM(MY_LIST, 4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Rather, if you have a list, the list object itself has a number of methods for doing things to it, such as appending a new element:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    MY_LIST = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "    MY_LIST.append(4)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- There is a thing in Python about modifying objects **in place** versus returning a copy. Append modifies in place.\n",
    "- **What does this mean?** In a language such as Python you'll see lots of methods being applied to objects. \n",
    "  - This will be *extremely* convenient when we work with data because we can \"chain\" methods\n",
    "  - Instead of writing 10 lines of code to reshape and filter your data, you can do it in 1 line\n",
    "- If you haven't done OOP, just go with it and it'll make sense/click at some point \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending basic Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start a new session, Python comes in with certain basic set of commands \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we typically want to extend functionality by bringing in additional functions written by others\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every Python example that you see starts with a bunch of **import** statements, such as \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll come back to the meaning of these statements after introducing some basics\n",
    "\n",
    "- To see what methods an object has, write [object]. and press tab\n",
    "  - You can also use this to autocomplete\n",
    "\n",
    "- To see information about objects and \"docstring\" (manual page), write object? or object??\n",
